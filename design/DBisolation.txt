Dirty Read and Non-Repeatable Read :  Non-repeatable read consists in reading two different committed values, whereas dirty read consists in reading a value that hasn't been committed yet

Dirty read 
 Accessing an updated value that has not been committed is considered a dirty read because it is possible for that value to be rolled back to its previous value

Non-Repeatable Read
A non-repeatable read occurs when transaction A retrieves a row, transaction B subsequently updates the row,
 and transaction A later retrieves the same row again. Transaction A retrieves the same row twice but sees different data.

Phontam Read
 A phantom read occurs when, in the course of a transaction, two identical queries are executed, 
 and the collection of rows returned by the second query is different from the first.
