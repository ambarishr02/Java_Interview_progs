Multi-Master approach
  Multiple DB to generates key  Ex : 1, 3 ,5 key will be gen  by Mysql1  , 2, 4, 6 Ex: by mysql2 , increase it K where k is number of servers 

UUID (128 bit)
  Might be Non Numaric ,  Its 128 bit long 
  Pros :
     No Sync is required , easy,Each server independtly invoke UUID

Ticker server  (Single mysql server with auto increments)
  Centralised ticket server 
   Single point failure

  41 bit-timestamp
  5 bit- datacenter (2^5=32)
  5 bit- machine ID
  12 bit- sequence
In our design, we assume ID generation servers have the same clock. This assumption might not be true when a server is running on multiple cores. The same challenge exists in multi-machine scenarios 

  Time Sync issue might occure in For this network time protocol can be used
