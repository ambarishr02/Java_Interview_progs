RTMP (Real time messaging protocol) -> written on top of tcp/ip

Gossip protocol  (decentralized failure detection method)
    Each node maintains a node membership list, which contains member IDs and heartbeat counters.

    Each node periodically increments its heartbeat counter.

    Each node periodically sends heartbeats to a set of random nodes, which in turn propagate to another set of nodes.

    Once nodes receive heartbeats, membership list is updated to the latest info.

Failure Handling (Temporary)
    Minimum quoram approach
        After failure detected  with gossip  protocol ,  System needs to deploy certain mechanism to ensure availability 
         Strict quoram                              &    sloppy quoram 
          read and write will be blocked                 choses first W healty server to complete process and update server when it comes up(Hinted handoff)   
  
Permanent Failures 
   We need to impl anti-entropy protocol
     Anti-entropy involves comparing each piece of data on replicas and updating each replica to the newest version
